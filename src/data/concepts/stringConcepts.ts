    'What is a String? How does it differ from other data structures?',
    `
  **Definition:** A string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text.
  
  **Basic Structure:** Strings are immutable in many programming languages, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.
  
  **Example:**
  \`\`\`python
  my_string = "Hello, World!"
  \`\`\`
  
  **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Immutable:** Strings are immutable in languages like Python, Java, and C#.
  - **Sequence:** Strings can be treated as sequences of characters, allowing for operations like slicing and indexing.
  - **Text Representation:** Strings are used to represent text data, making them fundamental in many applications.

    `
  <h2>Advantages:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Text Representation:</strong> Strings are the primary way to represent text data in most programming languages.</li>
    <li><strong>Rich Operations:</strong> Strings support a wide range of operations like concatenation, slicing, and searching.</li>
    <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> Immutability can lead to safer and more predictable code, as strings cannot be accidentally modified.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Disadvantages:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Immutable strings can lead to performance issues when performing many operations, as each operation creates a new string.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> Immutable strings can lead to increased memory usage, as each modification creates a new string object.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Some operations on strings can be complex and require careful handling, especially when dealing with Unicode characters.</li>
  </ul>
  
  **Example:**
  \`\`\`python
  # Concatenation example
  my_string = "Hello"
  my_string += ", World!"  # Creates a new string object
  \`\`\`
  
  **Key Points:**
  - Strings are essential for text processing but require careful handling due to their immutability.
  - For performance-critical applications, consider using mutable alternatives like Python's \`bytearray\` or C++'s \`std::string\`.

    'Explain the difference between mutable and immutable strings.',
    `
  **Mutable Strings:**
  - **Modifiable:** Mutable strings can be modified after creation.
  - **Memory Efficiency:** Mutable strings can be more memory-efficient for operations that require frequent modifications.
  - **Example:** In Python, a \`bytearray\` is a mutable string: \`my_bytearray = bytearray("Hello", "utf-8")\` and you can modify it directly.
  
  **Immutable Strings:**
  - **Unchangeable:** Immutable strings cannot be modified after creation.
  - **Safety:** Immutability can lead to safer and more predictable code, as strings cannot be accidentally modified.
  - **Example:** In Python, a regular string is immutable: \`my_string = "Hello"\`. Any modification creates a new string object.
  
  **Key Points:**
  - Mutable strings are more flexible but require careful handling to avoid unintended modifications.
  - Immutable strings are safer but can lead to performance issues for frequent modifications.

  **Common String Operations and Methods:**
  - **Concatenation:** Joining two strings together.
    \`\`\`python
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "World"
    result = str1 + " " + str2  # "Hello World"
    \`\`\`
  - **Slicing:** Extracting a substring.
    \`\`\`python
    my_string = "Hello, World!"
    substring = my_string[7:12]  # "World"
    \`\`\`
  - **Searching:** Finding the position of a substring.
    \`\`\`python
    my_string = "Hello, World!"
    position = my_string.find("World")  # 7
    \`\`\`
  - **Replacement:** Replacing a substring with another.
    \`\`\`python
    my_string = "Hello, World!"
    new_string = my_string.replace("World", "Universe")  # "Hello, Universe!"
    \`\`\`
  - **Case Conversion:** Converting the case of characters.
    \`\`\`python
    my_string = "Hello, World!"
    lower_case = my_string.lower()  # "hello, world!"
    upper_case = my_string.upper()  # "HELLO, WORLD!"

    'What are Unicode and UTF-8, and how do they relate to strings?',
    `
  **Unicode:**
  - **Definition:** Unicode is a standard for encoding, representing, and handling text in different writing systems.
  - **Character Set:** Unicode defines a unique number (code point) for every character, no matter the platform, program, or language.
  - **Example:** The character "A" has a Unicode code point of U+0041.
  
  **UTF-8:**
  - **Definition:** UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set.
  - **Encoding:** UTF-8 uses 1 to 4 bytes per character, making it efficient for both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.
  - **Example:** The character "A" is encoded as a single byte (0x41), while "â‚¬" is encoded as three bytes (0xE2 0x82 0xAC).
  
  **Relation to Strings:**
  - **Text Representation:** Strings in many programming languages are represented using Unicode, and UTF-8 is a common encoding for storing and transmitting these strings.
  - **Handling:** Proper handling of Unicode and UTF-8 is crucial for ensuring that text is displayed correctly across different platforms and languages.
  
  **Key Points:**
  - Unicode provides a universal character set, while UTF-8 is a widely used encoding for representing Unicode characters.
  - Understanding Unicode and UTF-8 is essential for working with text in a global context.
