const methodSignaturesData: LessonContent = {

  content: `
A method signature defines a function's name, its parameters, and (optionally) its return type. In Python, type hints help clarify intent even though they are not enforced at runtime.

<h3>
Defining Methods in Python
</h3>

  
Python methods are defined with the \`def\` keyword, and type hints can be added for parameters and return values. For example, if a method calculates a sum, its signature can indicate it accepts two integers and returns an integer.

<h3>
Example: Method with Type Hints
</h3>

\`\`\`python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b
\`\`\`

<h3>
Naming and Parameter Considerations
</h3>

  
Good method signatures use descriptive names and keep parameter lists concise. Avoid overly long lists by grouping related parameters into objects if needed.

const propertyGetSetData: LessonContent = {
  title: 'Getter/Setter Patterns',
  content: `
Getter and setter methods encapsulate access to an object's properties. In Python, direct attribute access is common, but using getters and setters (or the @property decorator) adds validation and flexibility.

<h3>
Direct vs. Encapsulated Access
</h3>

  
Direct access is simple and idiomatic in Python, but for sensitive data or where extra processing is required, getters and setters provide controlled access.

<h3>
Using the @property Decorator
</h3>

  
The @property decorator lets you define methods that are accessed like attributes. This makes your code cleaner while allowing you to add logic when getting or setting a value.

<h3>
Example: BankAccount with Property
</h3>

\`\`\`python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance: float):
        self.__balance = balance

    @property
    def balance(self) -> float:
        return self.__balance

const methodPitfallsData: LessonContent = {
  title: 'Common Pitfalls',
  content: `
Poorly designed methods can lead to hard-to-maintain code. Common pitfalls include long parameter lists, hidden side effects, and performance issues.

<h3>
Long Parameter Lists
</h3>

  
Having too many parameters makes a method hard to use and understand. Group related parameters into a single object or use defaults where possible.

<h3>
Hidden Side Effects
</h3>

  
Methods should ideally not change global state or modify inputs unexpectedly. Pure functions (without side effects) are easier to test and debug.

<h3>
Performance Considerations
</h3>

  
Avoid unnecessary computations or operations inside frequently called methods. Strive for clarity and efficiency.

Immutability reduces side effects by ensuring that once an object is created, its state cannot be changed. This is especially useful in functional programming or when working in concurrent environments.

<h3>
Benefits of Immutability
</h3>

  
Immutable objects simplify reasoning about code, prevent accidental modifications, and improve thread-safety.

<h3>
Strategies in Python
</h3>

  
- Use tuples instead of lists for fixed collections.  
- Avoid providing setters or mutable methods.  
- Use frozen dataclasses (\`@dataclass(frozen=True)\`) for simple immutable objects.

<h3>
Example: Frozen Dataclass
</h3>

\`\`\`python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

p = Point(1.0, 2.0)
# p.x = 3.0  # This would raise a FrozenInstanceError
