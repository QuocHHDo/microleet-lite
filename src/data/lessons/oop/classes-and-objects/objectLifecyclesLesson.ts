// 1) Instantiation
const instantiationData: LessonContent = {
  title: 'Instantiation',
  content: `
**Instantiation** is the process of allocating space for an object and preparing it for use. In Python, instantiation occurs when you call a class like a function, e.g., \`obj = MyClass()\`. This calls the class\'s \`__new__\` method (rarely overridden) and then \`__init__\`.

<h3>Python Instantiation Steps</h3>

1. **\`__new__\`**: Allocates memory and returns a new instance (uncommon to override, but possible).
2. **\`__init__\`**: Initializes the instance\'s attributes.

<h3>Example</h3>

\`\`\`python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Instance being initialized")

obj = MyClass()  # Instantiation triggers __new__ then __init__
\`\`\`

In Python, object instantiation is a two-step process. First, __new__ is a special method that actually creates the object 
in memory. Then, __init__ is called to initialize the attributes of the newly created instance. 
Many other languages merge these steps into a single constructor call. 
In Python, developers rarely override __new__ unless they need fine-grained control over object creation itself, 
like implementing a singleton pattern or returning instances of different classes.

// 2) Initialization
const initializationData: LessonContent = {

After an object is instantiated, **initialization** completes any setup tasks, typically in Python\'s **\`__init__\`** method. This step sets attributes, checks invariants, or loads resources.

<h3>Python\'s __init__ Method</h3>

- Runs after \`__new__\` returns a new instance.
- Prepares the object for immediate usage, raising exceptions if conditions aren\'t met.

<h3>Example</h3>

\`\`\`python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username):
        if not username:
            raise ValueError("Username cannot be empty.")

// 3) Garbage Collection
const garbageCollectionData: LessonContent = {

  content: `
In Python, **garbage collection** automatically frees memory when objects are no longer needed. Python primarily uses reference counting plus a cyclic garbage collector to handle objects with circular references.

<h3>Reference Counting</h3>

- Each object tracks how many references point to it.
- When the count drops to zero, Python deallocates the object immediately in CPython.

<h3>Cyclic Garbage Collector</h3>

- Handles objects that reference each other in a cycle, which reference counting alone can\'t free.

<h3>Example</h3>

\`\`\`python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

# If two nodes reference each other, only the cyclic GC can free them.

      solution: `"""
Reference counting increments an object's count whenever a new reference is made, 
and decrements it when references go out of scope. If objects point to each other in a loop, 
the count never drops to zero automatically. CPython's cycle collector identifies these loops and reclaims them.

Example:
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ref = None

obj1 = A()
obj2 = A()
obj1.ref = obj2
obj2.ref = obj1  # circular reference

Python's garbage collector automatically frees memory for objects no longer used. 
However, resources like open files or network sockets aren't purely memory objects; 
they hold external resources requiring explicit closure. 
Python provides context managers (the 'with' statement) to ensure such resources 
are properly released even in the face of exceptions.

// 4) Destructors & Finalizers
const destructorsFinalizersData: LessonContent = {
  title: 'Destructors & Finalizers',
  content: `
In some languages, destructors or finalizers are called when an object is destroyed. Python offers the **\`__del__\`** method, but its usage is discouraged due to unpredictability in timing. Resource management is typically handled via context managers or explicit close methods.

<h3>Python\'s __del__ Method</h3>

- Called when an object\'s reference count hits zero or the GC finalizes it.
- Not guaranteed to be called immediately or at all if cyclic references exist.
- Can complicate code if it tries to do important work.

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

- Use **with** statement and context managers to manage resources (files, locks, etc.).
- Avoid relying on __del__ for essential logic. 

<h3>Example</h3>

    def __del__(self):
        print("Object being finalized, but timing not guaranteed!")

# Using "with" ensures prompt cleanup.

Python's garbage collection does not guarantee when an object is finalized, 
so __del__ might not run immediately or at all if there are reference cycles.

Python favors context managers for deterministic cleanup.
